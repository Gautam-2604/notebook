## Instructions to run the project

npm install
npm run dev
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Assumptions

We are not actually connecting to a DB.
We are storing the config to DB connection in locl storage, and will only be removed once we click button.
We use context to store both messages, config, and connection status
Again, we are using schema as same from MySQL and PostgreSQL, from mockSchema

## Issues & Enhancements

We have added toasts, for DB connection
I have made the website responsive
Issue: Hydration Error was solved
